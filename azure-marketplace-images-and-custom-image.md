# Azure Virtual Machine Images: Marketplace vs Custom

In Azure, there are two main types of virtual machine (VM) images:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Azure Marketplace Images

Azure Marketplace Images are **predefined templates** provided by **Microsoft or third-party vendors**. These images are built to support **standard use cases** and are frequently updated and maintained.

### üîπ Features:
- Provided via the **Azure Marketplace**
- Used for common workloads like:
  - Windows Server
  - Ubuntu, Red Hat
  - SQL Server, Jenkins, WordPress, etc.
- Quick to deploy
- Maintained by the image publisher

### üìå Example:
> Creating a VM with "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS" from the Marketplace.

## ‚úÖ 2. Custom Images

Custom Images are **user-defined VM images** captured from a **configured parent VM**. These are useful for replicating an environment with **pre-installed software**, custom settings, or specific configurations.

### üîπ Features:
- Captured from an existing VM
- Includes:
  - Operating System
  - Installed applications
  - Configurations and settings
- Can be stored as:
  - Managed Images
  - Shared Image Gallery
- Ideal for scaling and automation

### üìå Example:
> Setting up a VM with custom security software, then capturing it as a reusable custom image.
