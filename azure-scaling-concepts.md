## Azure Scaling Concepts

Azure supports two types of scaling:

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- **Definition**: Increasing or decreasing the number of virtual machines.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for distributed systems, load balancing, and high availability.
- **Also Known As**: Scale out / Scale in.

### 2. Vertical Scaling
- **Definition**: Updating the existing VM configuration to a more powerful one.
- **Example**: Changing from a VM size with 2 vCPUs to one with 8 vCPUs.
- **Also Known As**: Scale up / Scale down.

### Horizontal Scaling
Increasing or decreasing the number of virtual machines.  
âœ… In Azure, this is implemented using **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**.

### Vertical Scaling
Changing the configuration of a virtual machine to a higher or lower specification.

In vertical scaling, a **VM reboot is required** because it involves changing the **underlying server hardware**.

## Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

**Virtual Machine Scale Sets** is an Azure service used to perform both **horizontal** and **vertical** scaling of virtual machines.

In a VMSS unit, you can define **autoscaling rules** to handle changing workloads automatically.

### How It Works:
- When traffic enters your application, a **load balancer** distributes it across existing VM instances.
- As traffic increases, **CPU utilization** rises, potentially degrading performance.
- To prevent this, a **trigger** activates based on the autoscaling rule.
- Depending on traffic, the rule may:
  - **Scale out**: Add more VM instances.
  - **Scale in**: Remove VM instances to optimize cost and performance.
- These newly created instances are automatically added to the **backend pool** of the **Standard Load Balancer**, which now distributes traffic equally across the updated group of VMs.

## VMSS and Load Balancer Integration

In Azure, **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)** can be used:

- âœ… **With a Load Balancer**:  
  - Ideal for distributing incoming traffic evenly across VM instances.
  - Supports both **internal** and **public** load balancers.

- âœ… **Without a Load Balancer**:  
  - Suitable for background tasks, batch processing, or internal-only workloads.
  - VM instances can still be accessed directly (e.g., via private IP or custom networking).

> ðŸ’¡ Using a Load Balancer with VMSS is optional and depends entirely on the application's architecture and traffic requirements.
