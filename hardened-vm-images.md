## 🛡️ Hardened VM Images

**Hardened VM Images** are **securely configured** virtual machine images that are designed to **minimize vulnerabilities** and reduce the **attack surface** of the system.

These images are pre-configured to:
- **Close unnecessary ports and services**
- **Apply latest security patches**
- **Enforce strong access controls and policies**
- **Disable insecure protocols**
- **Remove default or unused software**

### 🎯 Purpose:
To ensure the deployed VM has **no loopholes, weak spots, or misconfigurations** that could allow infiltration, malware injection, or unauthorized access.

---

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Environments handling **sensitive data**
- **Defense**, **government**, or **enterprise-grade** systems
- Systems needing **compliance** with security standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, NIST, ISO 27001)

---

### 🔐 Example:
A Linux VM hardened to comply with **CIS Level 1** baseline might:
- Disable root login over SSH
- Enforce password complexity
- Enable firewall (ufw/iptables)
- Remove unused packages and compilers

---

### 🧰 Tips for Hardening:
- Use tools like **Azure Security Center**, **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**, or **Ansible hardening roles**
- Regularly scan with **vulnerability assessment tools**
- Base custom images on **hardened golden images**

> ✅ Hardened images = "Secure-by-Design" foundation for your cloud infrastructure.
